 - Computer Organization v.s Computer Architecture
 - Structure and functions 
 - 4 basic functions of the system 
 - structure of the system
 
 Organization: actual physical componenets of the system (hardware details and how they interect with each other)
	- Transparent to the programmer (implementation of hardware details are abstracted from the great all mighty computer programmers)
		Ex. Controll signal?? (??? = will learn more about later) 
			Memory System ??
			
 Architecture: attributes that are visible to the programmer and have  direct impact to the program.
	
	Ex. ISA -> Instruction SET Architecture???
		The number or bits used to represent different data type
		Addressing Mode techniques??? 
		
 A computer is a complex System
	- Structure refers to the components and subcomponentes and how they interact with each other (top level view)
	- Function refers to how each of the components operate
	*What are the 4 basic functions of the system (see figure 1)
		- Data Storage 
			-Long term (disk)
			-Short term (ram)
		- Data Processing (applying operations to data)
		- Data Transferring (or moving as she calls it...)
			- if the device is connected to the system directly the process is called Input/Output (peripheral)
			- if the device is remote over longer distance the process is refereed to as communication
		- Control 
Structure of the computer (see figure 2)
	-cpu: central processing unit
		-instruction set and execute
		*Further broke down into components
			1.) Cu: (controll unit) controll the operation of cpu and hence controls the system. fetch instructions, decode, and execution (instruction system)
			2.) ALU: Arithmetic Logic unit. provide data processing functions 
			3.) Registers: provides internal storage for cpu
			4.) internal bus: allows the above components to communicate
	-System Bus: makes it possible for cpu memory and I/O to comunicate and exchange information
	-I/O: moves data into the system and out 
	-Main memory: (Ram)

-Multi Core System structure 
-central processing unit (cpu)
-Core (multi-processing)
-Processor
-PCB (printed circut board)
-computer history

	Single Processing Computer Cpu Componentes (review):
		- ALU
		- CU
		- Registers
	
	MultiCore Computer: Contemporary computers have multiple processors that are refered to multicore computers
	* these multi processors are placed on a single silicon chip
	* each processing unit is consisting of (ALU, CU, Registers, Cache) -> names as Core
	* Hence multiprocesser is same as multicore
	
	Multi level memeory (Cache; one of the most important reasons that computer are doing so well preformance wise  )
	|
	|-> cache is faster, smaller, and more exspensive per bit than main memory
	Cache comes in three levels. Cache is placed between main memory and cpu.
	Buffers the data (likely to be accessed in the near future) from main memory.
	
	PCB -> Printed circuiut Board
	- flat rigid board that interconnect chips and electronic components
	- the main PCB is referred to as System board or mother board (see figure 4)
	- Memory holds both Data and instruction
	- L1 cache is split into:
		- L1 I cache
		- L1 D cache
		split to avoid structured hazard (possibly mutating data in parallel)
	
	-Processor: a physical piece of silicon consisting of one or more cores. The processor is the computer component that
	fetches, interprets, executes instructions
	
	Computer history ZZZ.... :'( why!?!? why?!?!?! :/
	5 Generations: (roughly) Each generation we will see changes in terms of the following:
		- size
		- cost
		- power
		-efficiency
		-reliability
	1.)Vaccume tubes (1940-1956)
		- consumed alot of energy and generated lots of heat
		- slow and expensive 
		- large!! took up entire rooms
		- Machine language was used or binary to program the computers
		- As input, punch cards were used, and printed out as output
		-ENIAC, Univac: Von New Monn??
		
	2.)Transistors!! :D (1956 -1964)
		- computers became faster cheaper, smaller
		- programming lanugage used was assembly and some higherlevel languages like fortran and colbolt 
		- input -> punching cards
		- output -> print out
	3.)Integrated circuits!!(IC for short) :D (1964 -1971)
		- miniaturized transitions from previous gen and put them on a chip and called them integrated circuits
		- SSI-> small scale IC's
		- MSI-> medium scale IC's
		- LSI-> large scale IC's
		- Keyboard and monitors
		- Operating Systems
		- IC's drastically increasing speed & performance
	4.)MicroProcessors (1971- present)
		- thousand of integrated cicuits are placed on a silicon chip 
		- now, computers could fit in the palm of your hands.
		- Intel 4004 ship - 1971:
			- CPU, memory, I/O, components are placed on a single chip 
		-1981, IBM intriduced the first home computer 
		-1984, Apple introduced Mac
		-Development of mouse, hand-held devices, GUI
		
	5.) Artificial intelligence (present- future)
		- Less about hardware upgrade 
		- Voice recognition 
		- goal of this generation is to develop devices that respond to natural human language 
		as input and are capable of learning & self organization
		- nanotechnology 
		- Improving performance & use of parallel processing
		
	next class:
		- hypothetical machine 
		- MBR, MAR, IR, PC
