 - Computer Organization v.s Computer Architecture
 - Structure and functions 
 - 4 basic functions of the system 
 - structure of the system
 
 Organization: actual physical componenets of the system (hardware details and how they interect with each other)
	- Transparent to the programmer (implementation of hardware details are abstracted from the great all mighty computer programmers)
		Ex. Controll signal?? (??? = will learn more about later) 
			Memory System ??
			
 Architecture: attributes that are visible to the programmer and have  direct impact to the program.
	
	Ex. ISA -> Instruction SET Architecture???
		The number or bits used to represent different data type
		Addressing Mode techniques??? 
		
 A computer is a complex System
	- Structure refers to the components and subcomponentes and how they interact with each other (top level view)
	- Function refers to how each of the components operate
	*What are the 4 basic functions of the system (see figure 1)
		- Data Storage 
			-Long term (disk)
			-Short term (ram)
		- Data Processing (applying operations to data)
		- Data Transferring (or moving as she calls it...)
			- if the device is connected to the system directly the process is called Input/Output (peripheral)
			- if the device is remote over longer distance the process is refereed to as communication
		- Control 
Structure of the computer (see figure 2)
	-cpu: central processing unit
		-instruction set and execute
		*Further broke down into components
			1.) Cu: (controll unit) controll the operation of cpu and hence controls the system
			2.) ALU: Arithmetic Logic unit. provide data processing functions 
			3.) Registers: provides internal storage for cpu
			4.) internal bus: allows the above components to communicate
	-System Bus: makes it possible for cpu memory and I/O to comunicate and exchange information
	-I/O: moves data into the system and out 
	-Main memory: (Ram)
