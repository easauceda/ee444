### Combinational Circuits

### Digital Circuits

**Definition**: Hardware components that could manipulate with _Binary Data_


### Logic Gates

**Definition**: Basic form of a **digital circuit**. Performs specific logic operations.


### Binary Logic

**Definition**: Involves binary variables and logic operations.

**Binary Variable**: A variable that could have only two discrete values. (1 or 0).

Binary logic is similar to **Binary Arithmetic** but don't confuse them. 


### Boolean Algebra

**Definition**: An algebra that deals with binary variables and logic operations (AND, OR, NOT).

**Boolean Expression**: An algebra expression consisting of
 - Binary Variables
 - Constant 1 or 0


### Boolean Function

**Definition**: Can be described using truth tables, logical circuit diagrams, and boolean expressions.

### Basic Identities of Boolean Algebra
