## Different Types of Operations

### Data Transfer

Data transfer operations are **Load** & **Store**.

**Load**: Transfers data or instructions (that are stored in memory), from memory into CPU registers.

Everything that is stored in memory is going to have a specific address (always).

**Store**: Transfers data from CPU into Memory.

Load Example:

_Load 0XFE30 into Register 1_

`LW $1, 0XFE30($gp)`

Store Example: 

_Store the content of Register 3 into Memory Location 0XFE34_

`SW $3, 0XFE34($gp)`

### Arithmetic Operations

### Logical Operations
- Shift Instruction
 - **sll**: shift left logical
 - **srl**: shift right logical
 - **sar**: shift arithmetic right
 - **sal**: shift arithmetic left
- Rotate Right
- Rotate Left
- XOR
- NAND
- NOR
- AND
- OR
- NOT

Example:

Take the values of $1 & $2 AND, and place it into $3

```
$1 = 0100111
$2 = 1101010

AND operation for $1 & $2

AND, $3, $1, $2

  0100111
+ 1101010
---------
  0100010
```

Example:

Take the values of $1 & $2 OR, and place it into $3

```
$1 = 0100111
$2 = 1101010

OR operation for $1 & $2

OR, $3, $1, $2

  0100111
+ 1101010
---------
  1101111
```

Example: NOT

```
NOT(0100111) = 1011000
```

Example : XOR

``` 
$3 = $1 XOR $2

$3 = 1001101
```
