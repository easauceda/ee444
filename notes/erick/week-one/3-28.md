###Computer Organization vs Computer Architecture

**Computer Organization**

 - Refers to the actual physical component of the system
 - Hardware details and how they interact with each other
 - These attributes are **transparent** to the programmer
  - Control Signal
  - Memory System

**Computer Architecture**

 - Attributes that are **visible** to the programmer and have direct impact to the program.
  - ISA -> Instruction Set Architecture
  - The number of bits used to represent a datatype
  - Registers

**Example One**

Suppose we have a multiply instruction.

How do we implement this? 

This is an **Organizational** decision.

Repeated addition vs ...


###Structure & Function

**A computer is a complex system**

We need to understand:
 - Structure: Components, subcomponents & how they interact with each other.
 - Function: How each of these components operate, or what their responsibility is with respect to the whole system.

Before we can do that, we need to understand the **four basic functions of a computer system**

 1. Data Storage
  - Short-term & long-term
 2. Data Processing
  - If the device is connnected to the system **directly**, the process is called **Input/Output (I/O)** and the device is called a **peripheral**.
 3. Data Movement
 4. Control
