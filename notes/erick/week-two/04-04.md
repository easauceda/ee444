### Binary Addition / Subtraction Overflow Rule
**Terms**
 - **LSB**: Least Significant Bit
 - **MSB**: Most Significant Bit
 - **Cin**: Carry in 
 - **Cout**: Carry out

To determine whether overflow occurs, we must remember the **range**.

Unsigned: 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1

Signed: -2<sup>n-1 </sup> to 2<sup>n-1</sup> + 1

#### Methods to determine if overflow occurs

1. If two negative number or two positive number are added and the result has a different sign bit, **overflow occurs**.
2. If _Cin_ does **not* equal _Cout_ (Cin to the MSB is different than Cout), overflow occurs.
3. Checking range (?)

**Two's complement**:
 - Invert all the bits including the sign bit. (One's Complement)
 - Add 1 to the least significant bit.

### Hex Addition & Subtraction Overflow

![Hexadecimal Chart](http://www.learn44.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Binary-to-Decimal-and-Hexadecimal-Conversion-Memorization-Chart.jpg)

If Hex digit is >= 8, it means that value is negative. If Hex digit is < 8, it means that value is positive. 

If two hex numbers are added, if most significant hex digits are negative, and result MSHD is < 8, then overflow occurs.

If two hex numbers are added, if most significant hex digits are positive, and result MSHD is >= 8, then overflow occurs.

### Instruction Set

Instructions consist of two parts.

1. Opcode
2. Operands

**Opcode**: operational code
**Operands**: What instruction should be executed. Instructions are applied on opperands. 
**Instruction Set**: Group of instructions can be given to the computers

### Instruction Set Architecture

**ISA**: Preparing the microprocessor for users commands.
**CISC**: Complex instruction SET Computers
**RISC**: Reduced Instruction SET Computers


### Von Nuemann Architecture Characteristics
